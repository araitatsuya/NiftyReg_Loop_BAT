# NiftyReg_Loop_BAT
Running NiftyReg in for-loop using Batch in Windows environment. I highly discourage to install NiftyReg in Windows. Apparently the installation requires Framework 4.0 and older version of Visual Studio (2010?). But the current Windows system (as of May 2016 Framework 4.5) does not support the old library and keeps on rewriting to newer Framework.
